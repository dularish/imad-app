            <p>This is just an article about dogs. The innate quality that comes to our mind 
                whenever, we hear of dogs is loyalty. 'Loyal like a dog'. Dogs have been humans' best
                companion in the history. When wolves started to get close to humans, they
                thought they they could work together to each others' benefits. I cannot think of any
                other animal which is more close to humans than a dog.
