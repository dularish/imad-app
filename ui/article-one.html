            <p>This is just an ariticle about cats. They may look really cute but at the end of the day they are animals just
                like Lion, they have natural hunting instincts. They may sometimes bring live prey to the owner. They do
                it to their kittens, to teach them how to hunt this can be seen as a form of treating the owner as a part
                of their family.
